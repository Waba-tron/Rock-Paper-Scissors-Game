# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Fun little JavaScript game I made
# Installation
Just download a clone of this repository and then simply run it through a code editor of your choice
# Set a score
So by default, the set score will be set as 10. Likwise who ever reachs the set score first wins. But you are able to set a new score through out the game.
